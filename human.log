Flagged V genes below:	
TRAV1-2*02:	 Had no conserved C within 10 translated residues from the edge of the gene. Gene is recorded as functional. Gene sequence is also partial in 3', so conserved C was presumably lost. Using the translation details from the prototypical allele TRAV1-2*01.
TRAV13-1*03:	 Had no conserved C within 10 translated residues from the edge of the gene. Gene is recorded as functional. Gene sequence is also partial in 3', so conserved C was presumably lost. Using the translation details from the prototypical allele TRAV13-1*01.
TRAV14-1*01:	 Has multiple potential conserved C residues in its 3'. Gene is recorded as a pseudogene, and thus unlikely to translate anyway. Taking most 3'.
TRAV14-1*02:	 Has multiple potential conserved C residues in its 3'. Gene is recorded as a pseudogene, and thus unlikely to translate anyway. Taking most 3'.
TRAV14/DV4*04:	 Had no conserved C within 10 translated residues from the edge of the gene. Gene is recorded as functional. Gene sequence is also partial in 3', so conserved C was presumably lost. Using the translation details from the prototypical allele TRAV14/DV4*01.
TRAV26-2*02:	 Had no conserved C within 10 translated residues from the edge of the gene. Gene is recorded as functional. Gene sequence is also partial in 3', so conserved C was presumably lost. Using the translation details from the prototypical allele TRAV26-2*01.
